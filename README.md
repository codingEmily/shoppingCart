Shopping Cart-
A smaller-scale independent project as part of my CourseCareers Frontend Software Development Course
My Goal- in 5 hrs or less, to finish this project w/o any tutorial help and minimal AI research
TASKS
• Fetch data from JSON file
• Use data to handle "items" from store
• On user click, add items to "cart"
• have numOfItemsByType counter, counts items in shopping cart, but only one per TYPE of item (2 gallons of milk adds 1 to the counter for example)
• if the cart of NOT EMPTY, the cart icon appears in the corner. Its indicator holds the numOfItemsByType number
• if user hovers over the cart icon, a mini list appears, of all shopping cart items. It holds "name" x "number of instances of this name" = "total price of this type" for each item, and then "total price" at the bottom
• Example -> "Red x 3 = $33.00" "Blue x 1 = $12.00" "Yellow x 5 = $22.00" - Total: $67.00
